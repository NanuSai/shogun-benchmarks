# Shogun Benchmarks
The goal here is to benchmarks existing algorithms implemented in shogun repository and compare it to well known libraries say sklearn. This repository shall be focusing mainly on algorithms which implement the so called "kernel trick" and see how it scales with increasing k and measure the performance. Heavy inspiration has been drawn from [this repository](https://github.com/Saurabh7/shogun-benchmarks/)



More to come soon .. ! :D
